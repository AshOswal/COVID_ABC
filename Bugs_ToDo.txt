Things of Note:
20/03/2020:
	-[Not a bug - reminder to query how this works].
	-R.SimAn.pOptList = {'.E0_par','.alpha','.beta','.gamma','.delta','.lambda0','.kappa0'};
21/03/2020:
	-SimAn_ABC_220219b.m Line 290: Feeding saveMKpath a 1x13 Character array, when its expecting 1x1. Can be fixed by using stcat(), but not sure why this is a issue suddenly as this code worked prior today.
	-SimAn_ABC_220219b.m Line 226 + 229 + 231: Same issue as above.
	-Not super important, and prehaps not even really relevant to goal of model, but could be interesting to backcast model predictions from data start (22 Jan 2020) and verify to see if this agrees with first reported case (~17 November 2019).
